This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

## Purpose of the application

This application was created as my college degree thesis, this is the front-end of the application.
The purpose of the app was to create a web-app for tracking personal incomes and expenditures, 
and get a visualisation of these, or even generate an excel of the data within a specified date.
There are some other things as well, but I won't specify all of them here.
